# A Simple Introduction to RAG
 This repository is the source code for examples and illustrations discussed in the book - A Simple Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation

 Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, stands as a pivotal technique shaping the landscape of the applied generative AI. A novel concept introduced by Lewis et al in their seminal paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401), RAG has swiftly emerged as a cornerstone, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness in the outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs)


This book is a foundational guide designed particularly for beginners looking for an easy, yet comprehensive introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation. This book does not go deep into the technical nitty-gritties of RAG rather provides an overview. Data Scientists, Data Engineers, ML Engineers, Software Developers, Technology Leaders, Students and Academicians interested in generative AI powered application development will find this book valuable. Upon completing this book, you can expect to:

- Develop a solid understanding of RAG fundamentals, the components of a RAG enabled system and its practical applications.

- Know what a non-parametric knowledge base for RAG means and how is it created.

- Gain knowledge about developing a RAG enabled system with details about the indexing pipeline and the generation pipeline.
- Gain deep insights into the evaluation of RAG enabled systems and modularised evaluation strategies

- Familiarize yourself with advanced RAG strategies and the evolving landscape

- Acquire knowledge of available tools, technologies and frameworks for building and deploying production grade RAG systems

- Get an understanding of the current limitations of RAG and an exposure to popular emerging techniques for further exploration
